## Binary Search
Refer this post: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/786126/python-powerful-ultimate-binary-search-template-solved-many-problems

Refer solved problems [here](./Binary%20Search/)

Tip: Whenever we have some problems which tells to find `minimised max answer`, try to think `binary search`.

Refer solved problems [here](./Graphs/)

For 2d points, consider using indexes in adjacency map (Refer [Detonate the Maximum Bombs](./Graphs/2101.%20Detonate%20the%20Maximum%20Bombs.java))

### DSU complexity analysis

In union method, why do we set the parent which has greater size?

Refer these links
- https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/82728/in-disjoint-sets-why-do-we-make-the-smaller-tree-the-subtree-of-the-larger-one

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53149097/why-is-the-time-complexity-of-performing-n-union-find-union-by-size-operations
```
Let's say we have 2 nodes x and y in the union method

We find the parent and note down the sizes of the groups which have x and y.

Suppose the height of group containing x is heightX and similarly for y, it is heightY.

Case 1: heightX > heightY
If we attach node x to node y, the height would become heightX + 1

But if we attach node y to node x, the height would be height X 

So we attach node y to node x.

Case 2: heightX = heightY
In this case, the height of the resultant set would be heightX + 1
```

## Game theory

Solve problems by keeping the state of the current player. (And we can also remove the current player state if we see that it is not used in the recursive function)

Refer:
- [Nim Game](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/292.%20Nim%20Game.java)
- [Divisor Game](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1025.%20Divisor%20Game.java)
- [Stone Game IV](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1510.%20Stone%20Game%20IV.java)
- [Babylon](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/Babylon.java)
- [Candies Game](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/Candies%20Game.java)


Solve problems by the `Difference of scores method`

Refer:
- [Predict the winner](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/486.%20Predict%20the%20Winner.java)
- [Stone Game I](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/877.%20Stone%20Game.java)
- [Stone Game II](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1140.%20Stone%20Game%20II.java)
- [Stone Game III](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1406.%20Stne%20Game%20III.java)
- [Stone Game VII](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1690.%20Stone%20Game%20VII.java)


Solve problems by `sorting and greedy approach` (When the problem says that a player can pick any idx from the array for their score). 

Refer:
- [Stone Game VI](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1686.%20Stone%20Game%20VI.java)
- [Maximum Number Of Coins You Can Get](./Dynamic%20Programming/Game%20Stratergies/1561.%20Maximum%20Number%20of%20Coins%20You%20Can%20Get.java)

`Single Threaded CPU` and `Maximum Number of Events that can be attended` are similar.
